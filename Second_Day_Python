# Python operators
"""
Python operators used to operate on values and variables
Arthmetic operators
used to perform mathematical operations like addition subtraction and multipliction.

# Difference between == an is operator in python
# == is a comparsion operator.compare values of both the operands and checks for value equality.

# Functions directly convert one datatype to another.
#Implicit data type
# The python interpreter automatically convert one data type to another without any user involvement
