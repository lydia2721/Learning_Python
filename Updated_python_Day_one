# Naming and using variable in python
# Variable name can only contain letter and some special character like _ . They can start with letter and underscore but not with number.
# Spaces are not allowed in variable naming.
# Python keywords are not used like print.
# Variable name should be short and descriptive.
# It is better if we use lower case.

# Strings
# A string is simply a series of characters.
# Anything inside a quote is considered as string.
# They represent unicode characters.
#  a character is a string length one.
stringOne = "I'm geeks for Geeks student"
print(stringOne)
# Accesing elements of the string
# we can access individual character using indexing .
# we can use negative indexing in order to get back of the string.
geeks = "Geeks For Geeks"
print(geeks[-1])
print(geeks[0])
# Strings can be created using single double and triple quotes.
# Changing case in a string
# .title

# A method is an action that a python perform in a piece of data.

# Combining or concatenating string
first_name = "Lydia"
last_name = "Kebede"

print("Hello, "+ full_name.title() + " " + "!")
# Adding Whitespace to Strings with Tabs or Newlines

two = (" python " )
# in order to decrease the amount of the white space python rstrip() method
favourite_language = (" python ")
print(favourite_language.rstrip())
# Avoiding Syntax Errors with Strings
# With string trying to use apostrophe in the middle when using single quotes may rise an error.
