Geeks for geeks python course.
To print something on the console, print() function is used.
This function also adds a newline after our message is printed.
python programs are interpreted.
Arithmetic operations in python can be
performed by using arithmetic operators
and some of the in-built functions.

"""
Data types are the classification of data items.
Numeric
Data that has a numeric data value.
They can be integer, float and complex numbers.
Sequence Type
In python sequence is the ordered collection of similar or different data types.
They can be String, List and Tuple
String = A collection of one or more characters.we can put it in a single double or triple quotes.
List = an ordered collection of data.
Tuple = is just like lists tuples cannot be modified after created that is the main difference between list and tuples.
Boolean
have 2 values True and False
Set
unordered collection of data types that is iterable
, mutable, and has no duplicate elements.

Dictionary =  an unordered collection of data values, 
used to store data values like a map,
which unlike other Data Types that hold only single value as an element.
dictionary hold key and value.

type() this used to determine the type of datatype.
